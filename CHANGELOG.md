- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

### Known Limitations
- SQLite database (suitable for <100k flashcards)
- Single-region deployment
- Manual scaling required
- English-only interface (for now)

### Migration Notes
This is the initial release. For future migrations:
1. Always backup database before upgrading
2. Run migration scripts in sequence
3. Verify data integrity post-migration
4. Update environment variables as needed
