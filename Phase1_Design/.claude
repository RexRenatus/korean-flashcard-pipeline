# AI Assistant Guidance for Phase1_Design

When working with files in this directory:

## Context
This directory contains the foundational design documents created during Phase 1. These are **reference documents** that should generally not be modified unless documenting significant architectural changes.

## Guidelines

### Reading and Understanding
- Always read these documents to understand the original design intent
- Pay special attention to the rationale behind design decisions
- Note any constraints or limitations documented

### Referencing Design
- When implementing features, cite the relevant design document
- If implementation differs from design, document why
- Keep track of design-to-implementation mappings

### Updating Design Docs
- Only update if there's a fundamental design change
- Add "Updated: [date]" markers for any modifications
- Document the reason for the change
- Consider creating a separate "Design Evolution" document instead of modifying originals

### Common Tasks
1. **Finding Design Rationale**: Check SYSTEM_DESIGN.md first, then specific component designs
2. **API Implementation**: Start with API_SPECIFICATIONS.md for endpoint details
3. **Database Work**: DATABASE_DESIGN.md has the complete schema
4. **Integration Issues**: INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md covers external API patterns

## Important Notes
- These documents represent Phase 1 thinking and may not reflect current implementation
- Always cross-reference with actual implementation in src/ directories
- Design documents use pseudocode and conceptual models, not production code

## Do Not
- Modify these files unless documenting major architectural changes
- Treat pseudocode as implementation code
- Assume all design decisions were implemented exactly as specified
