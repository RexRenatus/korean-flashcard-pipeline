# Phase 1 Design Documentation

This directory contains all design and architecture documentation created during Phase 1 of the Korean Language Flashcard Pipeline project.

## Overview

Phase 1 focused on system design, architecture planning, and API specifications. All documentation here represents the initial design decisions and serves as the blueprint for implementation in subsequent phases.

## Contents

- **API_SPECIFICATIONS.md** - Complete API endpoint definitions, request/response formats, and integration contracts
- **DATABASE_DESIGN.md** - SQLite database schema, table relationships, and data modeling decisions
- **INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md** - OpenRouter API integration architecture and communication patterns
- **PIPELINE_DESIGN.md** - Two-stage processing pipeline architecture for flashcard generation
- **SYSTEM_DESIGN.md** - Overall system architecture, component interactions, and design principles

## Purpose

These documents serve multiple purposes:
1. **Blueprint for Implementation** - Guides development in Phases 2-5
2. **Reference Documentation** - Provides context for architectural decisions
3. **Change History** - Shows evolution of design thinking
4. **Validation Criteria** - Defines success metrics for each component

## Usage

When implementing features:
1. Always refer to the relevant design document first
2. If implementation deviates from design, document the change
3. Update design docs if fundamental changes are needed
4. Cross-reference with implementation in later phases

## Design Principles

The Phase 1 design follows these core principles:
- **Modularity** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalability** - Designed for concurrent processing
- **Reliability** - Error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Flexibility** - Adaptable to different vocabulary sources

## Status

âœ… **Phase 1 Complete** - All design documentation finalized
