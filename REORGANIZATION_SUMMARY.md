   git rm -r --cached Anthropic_Documentation_20250629/
   git rm -r --cached Open_Router_Documentation_20250629/
   git commit -m "Clean up deleted documentation references"
   ```

2. **Move data files** (low priority):

   - Move reference data to `data/reference/`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Review `README_DEPLOYMENT.md` for production setup
2. Push to GitHub repository
3. Set up CI/CD workflows
