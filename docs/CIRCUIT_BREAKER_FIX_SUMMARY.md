# Circuit Breaker Enum vs String Comparison Fix

## Issue Description
The circuit breaker tests were failing due to type mismatches when comparing the circuit breaker state. The `CircuitBreaker.state` property returns a string value (the enum's value), but the tests were comparing it directly against the `CircuitState` enum members.

## Root Cause
In `circuit_breaker.py`:
```python
@property
def state(self) -> str:
    """Get current circuit state as string"""
    return self._state.value  # Returns string like "closed", "open", "half_open"
```

In the tests:
```python
assert circuit_breaker.state == CircuitState.CLOSED  # Comparing string to enum
```

This comparison would always fail because:
- `circuit_breaker.state` returns `"closed"` (string)
- `CircuitState.CLOSED` is an enum member, not the string value

## Solution
Updated all test assertions to compare against the enum's value instead of the enum itself:

```python
# Before
assert circuit_breaker.state == CircuitState.CLOSED

# After
assert circuit_breaker.state == CircuitState.CLOSED.value
```

## Files Modified
- `/tests/unit/phase2/test_circuit_breaker.py`

## Changes Made
1. Replaced all occurrences of `== CircuitState.CLOSED` with `== CircuitState.CLOSED.value`
2. Replaced all occurrences of `== CircuitState.OPEN` with `== CircuitState.OPEN.value`
3. Replaced all occurrences of `!= CircuitState.OPEN` with `!= CircuitState.OPEN.value`
4. Updated conditional checks in the adaptive circuit breaker tests

## Test Results
All 22 circuit breaker tests now pass successfully:
```
tests/unit/phase2/test_circuit_breaker.py ...................... [100%]
======================== 22 passed, 1 warning in 34.05s ========================
```

## Alternative Solution (Not Implemented)
An alternative would have been to change the `state` property to return the enum directly:
```python
@property
def state(self) -> CircuitState:
    """Get current circuit state"""
    return self._state
```

However, this would be a breaking change for any code that expects the string value, so the test fix approach was chosen instead.
