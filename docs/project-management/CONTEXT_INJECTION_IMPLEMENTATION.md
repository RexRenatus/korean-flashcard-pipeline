# Context Injection Implementation Summary

Generated: 2025-01-11

## Overview

Successfully implemented context injection for the unified hook dispatcher, inspired by the Claude Code Development Kit's approach to automatic context enrichment.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Context Injector (`scripts/hooks/context_injector.py`)

A comprehensive context enrichment system that automatically adds:

#### Project Information
- Project type detection (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, etc.)
- Language detection based on file extensions
- Test presence detection
- CI/CD configuration detection
- Git repository information (branch, commit, dirty state)
- Project structure analysis

#### File Context
- File metadata (size, modified time, hash)
- Extension-based categorization
- Test file detection
- Python-specific analysis (imports, classes, functions)
- Module name extraction

#### Operation Context
- Operation type and tool information
- Validation hints for different operations
- Documentation search hints
- File modification tracking

#### Environment Context
- Python version
- Platform information
- Virtual environment status
- Session tracking

### 2. Enhanced Unified Dispatcher

Updated `scripts/hooks/unified_dispatcher.py` to:
- Initialize context injector on startup
- Enrich context before hook selection and execution
- Use enriched context for smarter hook selection
- Include enriched data in cache keys

### 3. Smart Hook Selection

The dispatcher now makes intelligent decisions based on context:
- Only runs SOLID checks on non-test Python files
- Skips syntax checks for unsupported file types
- Uses project type for future enhancements
- Logs selection decisions for debugging

## Benefits

### 1. **Smarter Hook Execution**
- Hooks only run when relevant
- Test files skip SOLID principle checks
- Language-specific validators are selected automatically

### 2. **Better Caching**
- Cache keys include git commit hash
- File-specific hashes ensure cache validity
- Project context enables cross-file caching

### 3. **Rich Context for Hooks**
Hooks now receive detailed context including:
```python
{
    'project': {
        'type': 'python',
        'languages': ['python', 'yaml', 'json'],
        'has_tests': True,
        'git': {
            'branch': 'main',
            'commit': 'abc123',
            'is_dirty': False
        }
    },
    'file': {
        'extension': '.py',
        'is_test': False,
        'hash': '12345678',
        'module': 'scripts.hooks.context_injector'
    },
    'operation_context': {
        'requires_validation': True,
        'modifies_files': True
    }
}
```

### 4. **Foundation for Future Features**
The context injection system provides a foundation for:
- Notification system (Phase 2) - can use project/file context
- Pre-flight security scanner (Phase 3) - can use git/environment context
- Rich context system (Phase 5) - already partially implemented

## Integration with Existing System

The context injection seamlessly integrates with our existing optimizations:
- Works with parallel execution
- Compatible with circuit breaker
- Enhances cache efficiency
- Monitored by performance tracker

## Usage

The context injection happens automatically when hooks are dispatched:

```python
# Context is automatically enriched
results = await dispatcher.dispatch('Write', 'validate', {
    'file_path': 'example.py'
})
```

Hooks receive the enriched context in their environment:
```bash
# In hook scripts
HOOK_CONTEXT contains full enriched context as JSON
```

## Next Steps

With context injection complete, we can now:
1. Implement notification system using context awareness
2. Create pre-flight security scanner with git context
3. Add more sophisticated hook selection rules
4. Implement context-aware caching strategies

The context injection provides a solid foundation for making our hook system even more intelligent and efficient.
