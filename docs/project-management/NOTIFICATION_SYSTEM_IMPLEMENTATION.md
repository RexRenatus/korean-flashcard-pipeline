# Notification System Implementation Summary

Generated: 2025-01-11

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive notification system for the unified hook dispatcher, inspired by the Claude Code Development Kit's non-blocking notification approach.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Notification Manager (`scripts/hooks/notification_manager.py`)

A powerful notification system with multiple features:

#### Core Features
- **Non-blocking notifications**: Uses background thread with queue for async processing
- **Multiple notification channels**:
  - Console (with colors and icons)
  - Sound (platform-specific)
  - File logging (JSON format)
  - System notifications (OS-specific)
- **Priority levels**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- **Notification types**: INFO, SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR, PERFORMANCE, TASK_COMPLETE, HOOK_VIOLATION

#### Key Methods
```python
# Async notification (non-blocking)
notify_async(message, notification_type, priority, context)

# Specialized notifications
notify_hook_start(hook_id, context)
notify_hook_complete(hook_id, success, execution_time)
notify_performance_violation(hook_id, violations)
notify_security_issue(file_path, issues)
notify_task_complete(task_description, duration)
```

### 2. Enhanced Performance Monitor

Updated `scripts/hooks/performance_monitor.py` to:
- Integrate with notification system
- Send alerts for performance violations automatically
- Trigger notifications when thresholds are exceeded:
  - P95 execution time > 10s
  - Error rate > 10%
  - Timeout rate > 5%

### 3. Enhanced Unified Dispatcher

Updated `scripts/hooks/unified_dispatcher.py` to:
- Initialize notification manager on startup
- Send notifications for hook lifecycle events:
  - Hook start (verbose mode only)
  - Hook completion (for long-running hooks > 5s)
  - Hook failures and timeouts
- Integrate with performance monitoring
- Record all execution metrics

## How It Works

### 1. **Background Processing**
```python
# Notifications are queued and processed by a daemon thread
self.notification_queue = queue.Queue()
self.worker_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._notification_worker, daemon=True)
```

### 2. **Channel-Based Routing**
Each channel has:
- Enabled/disabled state
- Minimum priority threshold
- Channel-specific configuration

### 3. **Smart Notifications**
- Only notifies for long-running hooks (> 5s)
- Respects verbosity settings
- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- Context-aware messages

## Configuration

Default configuration in notification manager:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "channels": {
    "console": {"enabled": true, "min_priority": "medium"},
    "sound": {"enabled": false, "min_priority": "high"},
    "file": {"enabled": true, "path": ".claude/logs/notifications.log"},
    "system": {"enabled": false, "min_priority": "critical"}
  },
  "rate_limit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_per_minute": 10,
    "burst_size": 3
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Non-Blocking Performance**
- Notifications don't slow down hook execution
- Background thread handles all notification processing
- Queue-based system prevents blocking

### 2. **Visibility**
- Real-time feedback for long operations
- Performance issues are immediately visible
- Security violations get critical alerts

### 3. **Debugging Support**
- All notifications logged to file
- Context included for troubleshooting
- Verbosity levels control detail

### 4. **User Experience**
- Visual feedback with colors and icons
- Sound alerts for critical issues (optional)
- System notifications for important events

## Integration Example

When a hook executes:
1. Dispatcher notifies hook start (verbose mode)
2. Hook runs with performance monitoring
3. Performance monitor records metrics
4. If violations detected, sends performance notification
5. Dispatcher notifies completion (if > 5s)
6. All notifications processed asynchronously

## Usage Examples

### Console Output
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Starting hook: security_check
‚úÖ Hook security_check completed in 6.2s
üìä Performance violations in slow_hook: P95 execution time: 15.3s
üö® 3 critical security issues found in config.py
```

### Notification Log Entry
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-11T10:30:45",
  "type": "performance",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "message": "Performance violations in slow_hook: P95 execution time: 15.3s",
  "context": {
    "hook_id": "slow_hook",
    "violations": ["P95 execution time: 15.3s"]
  }
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script to see notifications in action:
```bash
python scripts/test_notification_integration.py
```

## Next Steps

With the notification system complete, we can:
1. Create pre-flight security scanner (Phase 3)
2. Restructure hooks directory (Phase 4)
3. Implement rich context system (Phase 5)
4. Add custom notification channels (webhook, email, etc.)

The notification system provides immediate feedback and visibility into hook execution, making the development experience more transparent and debugging easier.
