# Pre-flight Security Scanner Implementation Summary

Generated: 2025-01-11

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive pre-flight security scanner that performs security checks before operations are executed, inspired by the Claude Code Development Kit's security-first approach.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Pre-flight Security Scanner (`scripts/hooks/preflight_scanner.py`)

A powerful security scanning system with multiple detection capabilities:

#### Security Checks
- **Credentials Detection**:
  - API keys, passwords, tokens
  - AWS credentials
  - Private keys (RSA, DSA, EC, OpenSSH)
  - Smart detection to avoid false positives
  
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**:
  - SQL injection (raw queries, string concatenation, format strings)
  - Command injection (subprocess with shell=True, os.system, eval)
  - Path traversal (../ patterns, unsafe path joins)
  
- **Sensitive Data**:
  - Social Security Numbers
  - Credit card numbers
  - Email addresses
  
- **Additional Checks**:
  - File permissions (world-writable files)
  - Git security (sensitive files in repository)
  - Python AST analysis (eval/exec usage, pickle)

#### Security Levels
```python
class SecurityLevel(Enum):
    INFO = "info"
    LOW = "low"
    MEDIUM = "medium"
    HIGH = "high"
    CRITICAL = "critical"
```

### 2. Enhanced Unified Dispatcher

Updated the dispatcher to:
- Run pre-flight security scan before any hooks
- Block operations if critical security issues found
- Return detailed security report on failure
- Log non-critical issues as warnings

### 3. Security Issue Reporting

Each security issue includes:
- Severity level
- Category (credentials, sql_injection, etc.)
- Description of the issue
- File path and line number
- Code snippet showing the issue
- Remediation suggestions

## How It Works

### 1. **Scan Process**
```python
# Before hooks run:
passed, security_issues = await scanner.scan(context)

if not passed:
    # Block operation and return security report
    return security_failure_result
```

### 2. **Smart Detection**
- Uses compiled regex patterns for efficiency
- Checks for false positives (placeholders, environment variables)
- Context-aware scanning based on file type
- AST parsing for Python-specific issues

### 3. **Configuration**
Default configuration:
```json
{
    "enabled": true,
    "block_on_critical": true,
    "scan_depth": "full",
    "checks": {
        "credentials": true,
        "sql_injection": true,
        "command_injection": true,
        "path_traversal": true,
        "xss": true,
        "sensitive_data": true,
        "dependencies": true,
        "permissions": true,
        "git_security": true
    },
    "whitelist_paths": [".env.example", "docs/", "tests/"]
}
```

## Example Security Report

```
Security Scan Report
==================================================

CRITICAL (2 issues):

  [credentials] Potential api_keys found
  File: config.py
  Line: 3
  Code: API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
  Fix: Use environment variables or secure credential storage

  [command_injection] Potential command injection via subprocess
  File: utils.py
  Line: 8
  Code: subprocess.call(user_input, shell=True)
  Fix: Avoid shell=True, use subprocess with list arguments

HIGH (1 issues):

  [sql_injection] Potential SQL injection via string_concat
  File: database.py
  Line: 3
  Code: query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '" + user_id + "'"
  Fix: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Proactive Security**
- Catches security issues before they're committed
- Prevents accidental credential exposure
- Identifies common vulnerability patterns

### 2. **Educational**
- Provides remediation suggestions
- Teaches secure coding practices
- Shows exact location of issues

### 3. **Configurable**
- Can be disabled for specific paths
- Adjustable security levels
- Custom pattern support

### 4. **Integration**
- Seamless integration with existing hooks
- Works with notification system
- Compatible with all other enhancements

## Testing

Run the test script to see the scanner in action:
```bash
python scripts/test_security_scanner.py
```

The test creates files with various security issues and verifies the scanner detects them correctly.

## Security Patterns Detected

### Credentials
```python
# Detected:
API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
password = "supersecret123"

# Not detected (safe):
API_KEY = os.environ.get('API_KEY')
password = "${PASSWORD}"
```

### SQL Injection
```python
# Detected:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '" + user_id + "'"
sql = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{name}'"

# Safe:
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
```

### Command Injection
```python
# Detected:
os.system(f"cat {filename}")
subprocess.call(user_input, shell=True)

# Safe:
subprocess.run(['cat', filename])
```

## Next Steps

With the pre-flight security scanner complete, we can:
1. Restructure hooks directory (Phase 4)
2. Implement rich context system (Phase 5)
3. Add more security patterns
4. Create security policy configurations
5. Add integration with security tools

The pre-flight security scanner provides an essential security layer that prevents common vulnerabilities from entering the codebase.
