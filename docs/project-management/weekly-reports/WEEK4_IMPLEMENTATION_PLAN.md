   - L1 (in-memory) and L2 (Redis/disk) cache tiers
   - TTL-based and LRU eviction policies
   - Cache key versioning
   - Distributed cache support

2. Implement cache features:
   - Lazy loading with cache-aside pattern
   - Write-through and write-behind strategies
   - Cache stampede prevention
   - Partial cache invalidation

3. Add cache warming:
   - Predictive cache warming
   - Scheduled cache refresh
   - Priority-based warming
   - Background cache population

### Day 5: Testing & Integration

#### Objectives:
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Benchmark performance improvements
- Document optimization strategies
- Create migration guide

#### Tasks:
1. Implement tests:
   - Connection pool stress tests
   - Query optimization verification
   - Cache hit/miss ratio tests
   - Performance regression tests

2. Create benchmarks:
   - Database operation throughput
   - Cache performance metrics
   - Memory usage analysis
   - Latency measurements

3. Documentation:
   - Performance tuning guide
   - Cache strategy selection
   - Database optimization checklist
   - Migration instructions

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Targets:
- **Database Operations**: 50% reduction in query time
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for frequently accessed data
- **Connection Pool**: <10ms connection acquisition
- **Batch Operations**: 70% reduction in round trips

### Architectural Improvements:
- Resilient database connections with automatic recovery
- Multi-tier caching with intelligent invalidation
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Efficient batch processing

### Integration Benefits:
- Works seamlessly with Week 1-3 improvements
- Reduces load on rate limiters through caching
- Improves circuit breaker success rates
- Enhances overall system responsiveness

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**:
   - Connection pooling (foundation for all DB operations)
   - Basic cache implementation (immediate performance gains)
   - Query performance monitoring (identify bottlenecks)

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Advanced cache features (nice-to-have optimizations)
   - Query optimization automation (can be manual initially)
   - Cache warming strategies (depends on usage patterns)

3. **Lower Priority**:
   - Distributed cache support (for future scaling)
   - Advanced monitoring dashboards (can use logs initially)
   - Predictive optimizations (requires historical data)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All database operations use connection pooling
- [ ] Cache hit rate exceeds 90% in tests
- [ ] Query performance improved by at least 50%
- [ ] Zero connection timeout errors under load
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show clear improvements
- [ ] Documentation complete and actionable

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Consistency**: Implement cache invalidation carefully
2. **Connection Leaks**: Add automatic cleanup and monitoring
3. **Cache Stampede**: Use lock-based protection
4. **Query Regression**: Maintain query performance tests
5. **Migration Issues**: Provide rollback procedures

## Dependencies

- Existing database schema and models
- Current cache implementation
- SQLite for persistence
- Optional: Redis for distributed caching
- Python packages: `aiosqlite`, `asyncpg`, `redis-py`
