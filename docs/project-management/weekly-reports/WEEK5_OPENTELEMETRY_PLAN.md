# Week 5: OpenTelemetry Migration Plan

## Overview
Week 5 focuses on migrating the Flashcard Pipeline to OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability. This will provide distributed tracing, metrics collection, and log correlation across all components.

## Goals
1. **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across multiple components
2. **Metrics Collection**: Gather performance and business metrics
3. **Log Correlation**: Link logs with traces for easier debugging
4. **Performance Dashboards**: Visualize system health and performance
5. **Zero-downtime Migration**: Seamless transition from existing monitoring

## Implementation Schedule

### Day 1-2: Core OpenTelemetry Integration
- Set up OpenTelemetry SDK
- Create instrumentation utilities
- Implement automatic tracing for HTTP/API calls
- Add manual instrumentation helpers

### Day 3: Component Instrumentation
- Instrument database operations
- Add tracing to cache operations
- Instrument rate limiter and circuit breaker
- Add business metrics collection

### Day 4: Exporters and Collectors
- Configure OTLP exporter
- Set up Jaeger exporter for development
- Implement Prometheus metrics exporter
- Create collector configuration

### Day 5: Testing and Documentation
- Integration tests for telemetry
- Performance impact testing
- Migration guide from existing monitoring
- Dashboard setup instructions

## Key Components

### 1. Tracing
- Automatic instrumentation for common libraries
- Manual spans for business operations
- Context propagation across async boundaries
- Baggage for cross-cutting concerns

### 2. Metrics
- Request latency histograms
- Error rate counters
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Database query performance
- Business metrics (flashcards processed, API calls)

### 3. Logging
- Structured logging with trace context
- Log-trace correlation
- Error tracking with span context
- Performance logging

### 4. Exporters
- OTLP for production (supports multiple backends)
- Jaeger for local development
- Prometheus for metrics
- Console exporter for debugging

## Benefits
1. **End-to-end Visibility**: See complete request flow
2. **Performance Insights**: Identify bottlenecks easily
3. **Error Tracking**: Correlate errors with traces
4. **SLA Monitoring**: Track service level objectives
5. **Debugging**: Faster root cause analysis

## Migration Strategy
1. Add OpenTelemetry alongside existing monitoring
2. Gradually instrument components
3. Validate data quality
4. Switch dashboards to new data source
5. Deprecate old monitoring code

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All API endpoints have distributed tracing
- [ ] Database queries include span context
- [ ] Cache operations are instrumented
- [ ] Metrics match or exceed current monitoring
- [ ] < 1% performance overhead
- [ ] Zero downtime during migration
