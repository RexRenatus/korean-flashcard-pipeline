- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Quarantine system for failed items
- TSV output format for Anki compatibility

### Metrics
- **Files Created**: 4 (MVP_DEFINITION.md, 4 design docs)
- **Files Modified**: 3
- **Documentation Pages**: 50+ pages of detailed design
- **Time Spent**: ~2 hours

### Next Steps
1. Create PHASE_ROADMAP.md with implementation timeline
2. Create ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md in ADR format
3. Begin Phase 2: Core Implementation (Rust)

### Where to Continue
Start with PHASE_ROADMAP.md to plan the implementation phases based on the completed design documentation. Focus on breaking down the MVP into 1-week sprints.
