# Project Requirements Questionnaire

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-07

## Purpose

This questionnaire gathers detailed requirements for the Korean Language Flashcard Pipeline to ensure optimal system design and implementation decisions.

## üéØ Project Requirements & Constraints

### 1. Volume & Performance

Please provide estimates for:
- **Batch Size**: How many vocabulary items do you expect to process per batch?
    - **I WANT EACH BATCH TO ATLEAST BE ABLE TO PROCESS 500 WORDS**

- **Daily Volume**: Expected number of items processed per day?
    - **I DONT EXPECT TO PROCESS THAT MANY, ONLY WHEN I AM RUNNING OUT OF FLASHCARDS AND NEED MORE TO BE MADE. BUT I WOULD STILL LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS AS MANY CARDS AS POSSIBLE, AND AS FAST AS POSSIBLE**

- **Monthly Volume**: Expected number of items processed per month?
    - **SAME AS ABOVE, NO GOAL FOR MASS PROCESSING AS OF YET**

- **Performance Requirements**: 
  - What's an acceptable processing time per item?
    - **AS FAST AS POSSIBLE WHILE REMAINING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OPENROUTER API LIMITS**

  - Do you need real-time processing or is batch processing acceptable?
   - **TELL ME WHICH OPTION IS BETTER, THAN WE CAN MAKE THAT DECISION**

  - Any specific latency requirements?
    - **NO NOT RIGHT NOW**

### 2. OpenRouter API Specifics

- **API Access**: 
  - Do you already have an OpenRouter API key?
    **YES REVIEW OUR @.env FILE**

  - What's your rate limit tier? (requests per minute/hour)
    **I DONT KNOW**


- **Budget Constraints**:
  - What's your monthly token budget?
    - **N/A**

  - Cost per 1M tokens expectations?
  - **N/A**

- **Model Selection**:
  - Should we optimize for cost or quality?
    - **LETS FOCUS ON BOTH, THATS WHY I WANT TO IMPLEMENT A CACHEING MECHANISM WHICH STORE CALLS BEFORE PROCESSING TO ENSURE WE STILL HAVE THE ORIGNAL OUTPUT IN THE FUTURE**

  - Use cheaper models for Stage 1 (semantic analysis) vs Claude Sonnet 4 for everything?
    - **WE MUST! ALWAYS USE CLAUDE SONNET 4 FOR EVERYTHING**

  - Any specific model preferences?
    - **REFER TO ABOVE**

### 3. Flashcard Requirements

- **Card Types**:
  - Besides Recognition and Production cards, do you need other types?
    - **NO NOT AT THE MOMENT**

  - Cloze deletion cards?
    - **N/A**

  - Audio cards?
    - **N/A**

  - Writing practice cards?
    - **N/A**
  
- **Card Fields**: What specific fields should each flashcard contain?
  - Front/Back only?

This towering presence perfectly captures how ÎÇ®ÏÑ±[nam.s å≈ã] embodies adult male person‚Äînot just any man, but the formal, clinical designation used in medical charts and government forms. The tree's solid verticality mirrors the term's authoritative precision in distinguishing masculine gender both grammatically and as an abstract concept.	term:ÎÇ®ÏÑ±,pos:noun,card:Scene,concept:metaphor,metaphor:oak_tree

The rough bark texture under fingertips reminds you how this distinction shapes every interaction.	term:ÎÇ®ÏÑ±,pos:noun,card:Usage-Comparison,comparison_term:ÎÇ®Ïûê

The hanja Áî∑ÊÄß[nam.s å≈ã] splits into two distinct components on rice paper‚ÄîÁî∑[nam] (male) shows a field Áî∞[t ∞jen] above strength Âäõ[nj åkÃö], depicting traditional masculine labor, while ÊÄß[s å≈ã] (nature/gender) combines heart ÂøÉ[sim] with life Áîü[s…õ≈ã]. Black ink bleeds slightly into fibrous paper as these ancient pictographs reveal how "male nature" became the formal designation for masculine gender. The musty smell of old scrolls mingles with fresh ink, grounding this clinical term in millennia of meaning.	term:ÎÇ®ÏÑ±,pos:noun,card:Hanja,hanja,character:Áî∑,character:ÊÄß

## Next Steps

Once you've filled out this questionnaire, we can:
1. Create a detailed system architecture
2. Define API specifications
3. Design the integration approach
4. Plan the implementation phases

Please take your time to think through these questions. The more detail you provide, the better we can tailor the system to your needs.
