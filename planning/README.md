## How to Use These Documents

### For Development
1. Check `MASTER_TODO.md` for current tasks
2. Update task status as you work
3. Document progress in `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`
4. Reference `PHASE_ROADMAP.md` for context

### For Planning
1. Review completed tasks in `MASTER_TODO.md`
2. Check `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` for recent work
3. Plan next tasks based on roadmap
4. Update estimates as needed

### For Onboarding
1. Read `PHASE_ROADMAP.md` for project overview
2. Review `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` for design context
3. Check `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` for recent history
4. See `MASTER_TODO.md` for current status

## Best Practices

### Task Management
- Keep tasks specific and actionable
- Include acceptance criteria
- Update status immediately
- Add new tasks as discovered
- Archive completed sections

### Journal Entries
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD Session Summary

### Accomplished
- ‚úÖ Completed X feature
- ‚úÖ Fixed Y bug
- ‚úÖ Updated Z documentation

### Challenges
- Issue with A: Solution implemented
- Blocked on B: Workaround found

### Next Session
- [ ] Continue with task C
- [ ] Test feature D
- [ ] Review PR #123

### Notes
- Important discovery about...
- Decision to change...
```

### Architecture Documentation
```markdown
## Decision: [Title]

### Context
What situation led to this decision

### Decision
What we decided to do

### Rationale
Why this approach was chosen

### Alternatives Considered
- Option A: Why not chosen
- Option B: Trade-offs

### Consequences
- Positive: Benefits
- Negative: Drawbacks
- Neutral: Other impacts
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Updates
- **Daily**: Update MASTER_TODO.md progress
- **Per Session**: Add PROJECT_JOURNAL.md entry
- **Per Phase**: Update PHASE_ROADMAP.md
- **As Needed**: Document architecture decisions

### Archiving
- Move completed phases to archive section
- Keep recent history accessible
- Preserve decision documentation
- Summarize learnings

### Review Cycles
- Weekly: Review and prioritize todos
- Monthly: Update roadmap estimates
- Quarterly: Architecture review
- Per Phase: Retrospective and planning

## Status Indicators

### Task Status
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Not started
- üöß **In Progress**: Currently working
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Finished
- ‚ùå **Blocked**: Cannot proceed
- üîÑ **Needs Review**: Requires validation

### Priority Levels

## Integration with Development

These planning documents should be:
1. Referenced in commit messages
2. Updated with PR merges
3. Linked in code comments
4. Used in sprint planning
5. Reviewed in retrospectives

## Tips for Effective Planning

1. **Be Specific**: Vague tasks lead to confusion
2. **Set Deadlines**: Even rough estimates help
3. **Track Dependencies**: Note what blocks what
4. **Celebrate Wins**: Document achievements
5. **Learn from Issues**: Record solutions for future reference
