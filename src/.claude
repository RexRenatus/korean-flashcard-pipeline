# AI Assistant Guidance for src Directory

## Overview
This is the main source code directory. Choose the appropriate language subdirectory based on the task.

## Quick Navigation

- **Python work**: Always work in `/src/python/`
- **Rust work**: Work in `/src/rust/` (currently planned, not implemented)

## Key Principles

1. **Language Boundaries**: Keep Python and Rust code strictly separated
2. **No Cross-Imports**: Never import across language boundaries directly
3. **Interface Through**: Database, files, or HTTP APIs only

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features
1. Determine if it's I/O bound (Python) or CPU bound (Rust)
2. Navigate to the appropriate language directory
3. Follow language-specific conventions

### Debugging Issues
- Start with the language where the error occurs
- Check integration points if crossing language boundaries
- Review database schemas for data flow issues

## Important Notes
- Currently, only Python implementation is active
- Rust directories exist for future optimization phases
- Don't modify Rust structure without architectural review

## Do Not
- Mix Python and Rust code in the same directory
- Create language-agnostic code at this level
- Add configuration files here (use project root)
