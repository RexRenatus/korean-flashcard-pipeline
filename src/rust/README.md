# Rust Implementation

This directory contains the Rust implementation for high-performance components of the flashcard pipeline.

## Status

ðŸš§ **PLANNED** - The Rust implementation is planned for future optimization phases. Currently, all functionality is implemented in Python.

## Planned Components

### Core Library (`/core`)
High-performance processing engine for:
- Text parsing and analysis
- Batch processing algorithms
- Performance-critical transformations
- Memory-efficient data structures

### Pipeline Binary (`/pipeline`)
Standalone executable for:
- Command-line processing
- Batch operations
- System integration
- Performance benchmarking

### Cache Implementation (`/cache`)
High-speed caching layer:
- In-memory cache with persistence
- LRU/LFU eviction strategies
- Compression algorithms
- Concurrent access optimization

## Why Rust?

The Rust implementation is planned to address:
1. **Performance** - CPU-intensive Korean text processing
2. **Memory Efficiency** - Large vocabulary dataset handling
3. **Concurrency** - Safe parallel processing
4. **Reliability** - Memory safety guarantees

## Integration Strategy

When implemented, Rust components will integrate via:
- Shared SQLite database
- JSON-RPC or gRPC APIs
- File-based data exchange
- Python bindings (PyO3)

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Processing
- [ ] Korean text tokenization
- [ ] Romanization algorithms
- [ ] Difficulty scoring
- [ ] Batch processing

### Phase 2: Optimization
- [ ] Caching layer
- [ ] Parallel processing
- [ ] Memory pooling
- [ ] SIMD optimizations

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Python bindings
- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] API server
- [ ] Performance tests

## Current Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Core library (planned)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/
â”œâ”€â”€ pipeline/       # CLI binary (planned)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml

    â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
    â””â”€â”€ src/
```

## When to Use Rust

Consider Rust implementation for:
- Processing >10,000 vocabulary items
- Real-time processing requirements
- Memory-constrained environments
- CPU-bound operations

## Getting Started (Future)

```bash
# Build all Rust components
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Install CLI tool
cargo install --path pipeline
```

## Note

Until Rust implementation is active, all functionality is available through the Python implementation in `/src/python/`. The Python implementation is fully functional and suitable for most use cases.
