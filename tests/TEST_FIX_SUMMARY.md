# Test Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all fixes applied to resolve test failures in the Korean Flashcard Pipeline project.

## Phase 1 Tests - FIXED 
- **67/67 tests passing**
- Fixed datetime issue in `test_items_per_second` by using timedelta instead of datetime.replace()

## Phase 2 Tests - IN PROGRESS =§
### Current Status: 24 failures remaining

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Import Issues**
   - Added `CircuitBreakerOpen` exception (alias for CircuitBreakerError)
   - Added `NetworkError` to exports in `__init__.py`
   - Fixed all exception imports

2. **Circuit Breaker**
   - Changed `state` property to return string value instead of enum
   - Added circuit breaker property to PipelineOrchestrator for test compatibility
   - Renamed internal circuit breaker to avoid conflicts

3. **Rate Limiter**
   - DistributedRateLimiter already has necessary properties
   - Added compatibility properties for test expectations

4. **PipelineOrchestrator**
   - Added missing constructor parameters
   - Added `process_csv()` method
   - Added `get_checkpoint()` and `resume_batch()` methods
   - Fixed circuit breaker integration

### Remaining Issues:
1. **API Client Mock Tests**
   - Mock response headers need to support dict() conversion
   - httpx response mocking needs adjustment

2. **Rate Limiter Timing Tests**
   - Tests are timing-sensitive and may fail in CI
   - Need to adjust test expectations or add timing tolerance

3. **Circuit Breaker Tests**
   - Some tests expect different state management behavior
   - May need to adjust test expectations

## Integration Tests - FIXED 
- Fixed import paths for PipelineOrchestrator
- Fixed missing imports (Comparison, AdaptiveRateLimiter, NetworkError)
- Added compatibility layer for circuit breaker access

## Next Steps:
1. Fix remaining Phase 2 mock tests
2. Run full test suite with proper dependencies
3. Fix any remaining Rust tests
4. Create comprehensive test runner script
